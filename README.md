# ðŸ“± Memento (Mobile Version) â€“ Debt Management App

**Memento** is a simple mobile-based debt management app designed for small retail businesses such as *Sari-Sari* stores. Built for Android using local storage, this version offers a more accessible and portable way for store owners to manage their customer debts â€” even without an internet connection.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose**
This mobile version brings the same core concept from the original web-based system but optimized for **on-the-go use**. The app is crafted for sari-sari store owners who prefer using their phones instead of desktops or laptops, with an interface that emphasizes usability, speed, and clarity.

## ðŸ§  **Key Features**
- Add, edit, and view debtor records
- Auto-calculate total debts per customer
- Clean, intuitive design inspired by self-care and minimal apps
- Offline functionality using local storage (no need for internet or database setup)

## ðŸŽ¨ **UI/UX Design Focus**
- Simplified action-driven flow: Users are presented with three main buttons right after login â€“ Add Record, Edit Record, View Debtors
- Large, readable text and high-contrast violet theme for better visibility and accessibility
- Designed specifically for non-tech-savvy users like sari-sari store owners, prioritizing clarity and fast navigation
- Side menu included for easy switching between views (mobile navigation drawer for better UX)

## ðŸ“Œ **Note**
This mobile version of Memento was developed as a continuation of the original web-based debt tracking tool created for a college course.  

After revisiting the project, @velox-dly and the team saw an opportunity to extend the idea to Android â€” offering **offline-first support** and a **refreshed UI/UX** aimed at solving real problems for small store owners.

There are plans to continue iterating on this project to improve its usability and add new features based on user feedback and experience.
